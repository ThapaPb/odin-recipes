        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> Chicken is one of the staple dishes of Nepali household. It is normally made in a curry style and is a household favorite. I used to desperately wait for Saturdays because my mom would make her famous Chicken every Saturday. It is served with freshly cooked rice, two or three different types of stir-fry vegetables, lentil soup and pickled relish.</p>
